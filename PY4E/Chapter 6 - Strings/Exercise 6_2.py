#Exercise 6.2: Given that fruit is a string, what does fruit[:] mean?
    
fruit = 'banana'
print fruit[:]

# Answer:   fruit[:] is the whole string stored in the variable fruit.
#This is because omission of the first index starts the slice at the beginning and omission of the second index goes to the end of the string.
