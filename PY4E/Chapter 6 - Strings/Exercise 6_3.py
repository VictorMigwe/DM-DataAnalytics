#Exercise 6.3: Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.
    
    
#word = 'banana'
#count = 0
#for letter in word:
#    if letter == 'a':
#        count = count + 1
#print(count)#

    for letter in word:
        if letter == my_letter:
            count = count + 1
    print (count)
